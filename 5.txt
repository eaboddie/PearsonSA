National Board
Certification

By Teachers for Teachers
Recognized as the “gold standard” in teacher certification, the National Board believes
higher standards for teachers means better learning for students.
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was founded in 1987 to
advance the quality of teaching and learning by:
•

Maintaining high and rigorous Standards for what accomplished teachers should
know and be able to do;

•

Providing a national voluntary certification process for teachers who meet these
standards; and

•

Advocating related education reforms to integrate National Board Certification in
American education and to capitalize on the expertise of National Board Certified
Teachers.

National Board Certification was designed to develop, retain and recognize
accomplished teachers and to generate ongoing improvement in schools nationwide. It is
the most respected professional certification available in K-12 education.

National Board Certification
Elevating Teaching, Empowering Teachers
•

National Board Certification is a voluntary assessment program designed to
develop, retain and recognize accomplished teachers, and to embed ongoing
improvement in schools nationwide.

•

National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) are highly accomplished educators who
meet the rigorous standards set by the National Board.

•

National Board Certification is an advanced credential. While state teacher
credentialing programs set the basic requirements to teach in each state, NBCTs must
demonstrate advanced teaching knowledge, skills and practices. It complements, but
does not replace, a state's teaching certificate or school counseling license.

6

The Certification Process
Portfolio Components
To become Board-certified, and for Maintenance of Certification (MOC), eligible
candidates must demonstrate advanced knowledge, skills, and practice in their individual
certificate area (based on the Standards) by successfully completing multiple evidencebased components.
This training module will focus on completing portfolio components.

After submitting a component, a submission confirmation is shown on the candidate’s
dashboard. It will remain there until score release preparations begin. Candidates can
use their browser’s print function to print a copy for their records.

•

If the candidate leaves files in the system and does not click the submit button, they
will automatically be submitted for them after the close of the submission window. Their
work will be submitted for evaluation as is. Candidates will see a submission
confirmation on their candidate dashboard at the end of the process.

•

Note: The National Board won’t audit or inventory the contents of any submission.
Each entry will be scored exactly as it was submitted. The ability to view portfolio
submissions is available in a candidate’s National Board account. With this feature,

‒ The option to request this service will only be available until May 24, 2025.
‒ Candidates can request it by logging into their National Board account and going to
My Journey > Services > ePortfolio Exception Service.
‒ Candidates seeking this exception will have a limited window to correct and
resubmit their completed portfolios. Note: This service will not provide candidates
extended time to collect evidence or prepare material. Extensions for completing
portfolios will only be considered for candidates with documented hardships, as
defined in the Guide to National Board Certification.

16

The Scoring Process
Portfolio Components
•

Components will be scored during the summer by classroom teachers in the
same certificate field. Many assessors are National Board Certified Teachers. All
assessors are extensively trained and must qualify before reviewing submissions.

•

Ultimately, a candidate's scores reflect the degree to which assessors were able to
locate clear, convincing and consistent evidence that they met the Standards.

•

Candidates who register for a component but fail to complete it will get an NS (Not
Scoreable) decision on their Score Report and it will count as one attempt at the
component.

•

Scores will be posted to a candidate’s National Boar account by December 31. Check
the knowledge base for exact dates.

•

The Scoring Guide and Guide to Maintenance of Certification explains everything.

The National Board and

By Teachers for Teachers
Recognized as the “gold standard” in teacher certification, the National Board believes
higher standards for teachers means better learning for students.
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was founded in 1987 to

•

National Board Certification
Elevating Teaching, Empowering Teachers
•

National Board Certification is a voluntary assessment program designed to

improvement in schools nationwide.

•

National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) are highly accomplished educators who
meet the rigorous standards set by the National Board.

•

National Board Certification is an advanced credential. While state teacher

Maintenance of
Certification

Maintenance of Certification
Accomplished teachers recognize that professional learning and growth never ends.
Maintenance of Certification (MOC) was designed by teachers based on best assessment
practices to ensure Board-certified teachers continue to grow professionally while
maintaining a strong impact on student learning.
•

MOC is the pathway for NBCTs to keep their National Board Certification active.

•

NBCTs have two opportunities, starting in their third year of certification, to
successfully complete MOC.

•

Successfully completing MOC extends an NBCT’s certificate by five years from their
certificate’s expiration date.

8

Why Maintain Certification
Elevating Teaching, Empowering Teachers
Maintaining certification is a personal and public statement about an NBCT’s
commitment to the profession and to their students.

9

Eligibility Requirements
Maintenance of Certification (MOC)
To be eligible for MOC’s two opportunities, NBCTs must meet the certificate and licensure
requirements described in the Guide to Maintenance of Certification.
Hold a valid (not expired) National Board certificate and state teaching license.

Purchase MOC by the deadline listed in the Maintenance of Certification Calendar:
• First opportunity – Registration opens during the third year of certification.

• Second/final opportunity – Registration opens during the fourth year of certification.
Note:

•

NBCTs who do not currently teach
students but serve in other roles in
education can still complete MOC.

•

MOC must be completed during the
assessment cycle in which it is
purchased. The National Board
doesn’t offer deferrals.

•

If an NBCT registers in their last year
of eligibility and isn’t successful, they
won’t be able to retry MOC. Future
attempts at certification would be as
a first-time candidate.

Completing MOC and
Maintaining Certification

The Portfolio
Maintenance of Certification (MOC)
•

MOC consists of a portfolio entry made up of two components that draw upon two
Professional Growth Experiences (PGEs) related to an NBCT’s original certificate area.

•

A PGE is an activity that taught the NBCT something new, had influence within or
beyond the classroom, and had a direct and/or indirect impact on student learning.

•

For MOC, NBCTs describe, analyze, and reflect on how their PGEs and teaching
practices continue to align with the Five Core Propositions, the Standards, and the
Architecture of Accomplished Teaching.
Component 1
•

Identify two PGEs.

•

Develop a Written Commentary in response to prompts.

•

Collect evidence that supports your PGEs and Written
Commentary and that demonstrates positive impact on
student learning.

Component 2
•

Choose one of your PGEs from Component 1 and show its
application with a group of students that match your
certificate area.

•

Design a lesson related to your PGE and prepare a video of
you teaching the lesson to a pre-K-12 class.

•

Develop a Written Commentary in response to prompts.

20

Submitting a Portfolio
Maintenance of Certification (MOC)
• Candidates should review the MOC Evaluation Rubrics and the certificate-specific
Standards for a better understanding of component requirements and what to submit.
• Many states, districts, and local-level NBCT Networks offer candidate support for
developing portfolios; the In Your State page has an interactive map that provides a
summary of available support.
• The MOC portfolio is submitted electronically through a candidate’s National Board
account during the submission window.
• Candidates will get instructions for submitting material right before the submission
window opens.

• Resource documents and tutorials for uploading and submitting material are in the
Candidate Center on the ePortfolio Submission page.

Interpreting the Portfolio Instructions
In compliance with National Board policy, the level of support offered to candidates preparing submissions is limited; however,
Customer Support (CS) can answer many portfolio questions using the knowledge base. CS can direct candidates to where
information is located within publications and clarify general submission requirements. CS cannot provide feedback or make
portfolio recommendations that could affect a candidate’s score. Review the knowledge base for the most up-to-date information
and handling instructions.

Definition and Purpose of Communication
Communication Defined
“Information communicated, transmitted, or conveyed in a verbal or written message.”

Purpose
The goal of written communication is to inform someone of information in a way that they
are able to read and understand the message, with an intention to respond or take
necessary action.
External Communication
External Communication takes place between a business and another person or entity in
the company’s external environment.

Effective Written Communication
Written communication usually requires more thought and effort. Writing must be
concise, informative and easy to read as both an informative and instructional tool.
The importance of written communication in business is evident by the plethora of
forms, manuals and materials that companies publish each day.

Written communication can take on many forms such as legal documents, manuals,
policies, memos, performance reviews, and general informational documents. All are
important to the daily function of a business, but each has a unique significance in
purpose.

Business communication takes place internally among employees, teams, and
organizations. However, a great deal of communication in the business world also
takes place externally with other entities that are necessary in the business process.

Importance of Written Communication
One of the more common communication channels with external parties is written
communication. It is a professional, but convenient way to share information with a
customer, vendor, or any other entity in which you must share a message. As with any
communication method, written communication poses a few inherent challenges.
Challenges with Written Communication
•

Written communication serves a record, so choose your words carefully.

•

Body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice are all critical factors that
account for over 90% of the communication process. However, these
communication methods are eliminated in written communication.

Remember! What you say and how you say it reflects on the organization.

Excel at Customer Support Daily
Nothing says thanks for your business better than a friendly and informed service
representative. It’s uncanny how thrilled customers are when a real human responds
and doesn’t work entirely from a script.

Same goes for National Board emails and chats — personal and friendly replies
(not purely canned ones!) let your personalities shine through.
Always focus on:
✓ Showing empathy;
✓ Using a positive tone;
✓ Using positive language
✓ Accuracy; and
✓ Being clear and concise

Writt en Com municat ions

14

Showing Empathy
Empathy is identifying and acknowledging the customer's feelings and issue they are
experiencing. Empathy is shown in how much compassion and understanding we can
give to another.

Put empathy into action in your emails and chats:
•

If the customer is distressed or experiencing a hardship, start with an empathetic
statement.

•

Apologize for any frustration the customer has experienced. This is especially
critical when they have expressed clear frustration, when they have been given a
runaround, or during an unplanned system event.

•

Be sincere when showing empathy to a customer.

Using a Positive Tone
Face to face and phone interactions don’t require explicit friendliness (you wouldn’t
grin at a customer two feet in front of you or shout “I see what you’re saying!),
because the tone of your voice and body language convey meaning that text alone
does not.
Without that extra meaning, email and chat suffer from the negativity effect, wherein
the recipient interprets the message as more negative than the sender intended.
Tone and punctuation:
• In most cases, you can create a more positive customer experience simply by
dressing up your communication with punctuation. Cues, like exclamation points,
can help the sender convey a positive tone the recipient may not otherwise
assume.
A word of caution: Exclamation points aren’t for everyone. Read the incoming
details for cues (Is the customer using formal or relaxed language? Are they angry or
do they just have a question?), and reply accordingly. If your customer initiates the
conversation with a greeting like “Hey folks!” that’s a good indication you can exclaim
to your heart’s content in your reply.
Writt en Com municat ions

16

Using Positive Language
Word choice:
• Avoid using emotive words in your communications and documentation - this will
make you seem subjective rather than objective. This can also make the customer
feel that you are making value judgments, for example:
Non-emotive: Mr. Klaus registered for National Board Certification and
purchased his components on February 28.
Emotive: Mr. Klaus procrastinated and waited until the very last day to
register for National Board Certification and purchase his components.

17

Accuracy
Accuracy, or a lack thereof, can greatly affect the overall customer experience. When
accuracy is maintained, the result is a happy customer that will hopefully be a longtime advocate for Pearson and the National Board.
Correct spelling, grammar, and (most importantly) program knowledge are crucial
indicators of quality.
Be sure to:
• Check the knowledge base for the very latest information.
• Review spelling and grammar for accuracy.
• Capture complete thoughts.
• Always give appropriate solutions.
• Avoid jargon and technical terminology.

Writt en Com municat ions

18

Be Clear and Concise
Writing clearly and concisely means choosing your words deliberately, constructing
your sentences carefully, and using grammar properly. By writing clearly and
concisely, you will get straight to your point in a way your audience can easily
comprehend.
Be clear and concise:
• Use simple words (no acronyms, abbreviations, etc.). The words you choose can
either enhance or interfere with your meaning and your audience’s
comprehension.
•

Replace vague words with specific ones. Vague words tend to be abstract and can
conceal your meaning. Specific words, on the other hand, precisely and shortly
convey your meaning.

•

Pay attention to sentence length and complexity. Don’t get fancy- say exactly what
you mean to say.

Optimizing Your Writing with AI
AI can enhance your writing by improving efficiency, ensuring accuracy,
maintaining consistency, and personalizing messages. You can use AI to quickly
draft emails to save valuable time. Use grammar checkers to avoid errors and
maintain professionalism. Keep a consistent tone and style across all
communications, and tailor content to specific audiences for better engagement.
Putting AI into action in your writing:
• Review AI suggestions thoroughly. Always edit AI-generated content to ensure
it aligns with your intent and company standards. Double-check for accuracy and
relevance.
• Maintain a human touch: Use AI to enhance, not replace, human creativity and
empathy. Show genuine understanding and compassion in your communications.
• Be mindful of ethical considerations.
‒ Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations to protect
customer information.
‒ Bias and Fairness: Be aware of potential biases in AI algorithms and strive
for fair and unbiased communication.

National Board
Certification

By Teachers for Teachers
Recognized as the “gold standard” in teacher certification, the National Board believes
higher standards for teachers means better learning for students.
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was founded in 1987 to
advance the quality of teaching and learning by:
•

Maintaining high and rigorous Standards for what accomplished teachers should
know and be able to do;

•

Providing a national voluntary certification process for teachers who meet these
standards; and

•

Advocating related education reforms to integrate National Board Certification in
American education and to capitalize on the expertise of National Board Certified
Teachers.

National Board Certification was designed to develop, retain and recognize
accomplished teachers and to generate ongoing improvement in schools nationwide. It is
the most respected professional certification available in K-12 education.

5

National Board Certification
Elevating Teaching, Empowering Teachers
•

National Board Certification is a voluntary assessment program designed to
develop, retain and recognize accomplished teachers, and to embed ongoing
improvement in schools nationwide.

•

National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) are highly accomplished educators who
meet the rigorous standards set by the National Board.

•

National Board Certification is an advanced credential. While state teacher
credentialing programs set the basic requirements to teach in each state, NBCTs must
demonstrate advanced teaching knowledge, skills and practices. It complements, but
does not replace, a state's teaching certificate or school counseling license.

6

The Certification Process
Performance Based and Peer Reviewed
To become Board-certified, eligible candidates must demonstrate advanced knowledge,
skills, and practice in their individual certificate area (based on the Standards) by
successfully completing four evidence-based components.
The content knowledge component is a computer-based assessment taken at a testing
center; the other three components are portfolio-based and submitted through an
electronic portfolio system in the spring.
Computer-based assessment
• Component 1: Content Knowledge (comprised of 4 parts - 1 selected response part
and 3 constructed response items)

Portfolio entries
• Component 2: Differentiation in Instruction
• Component 3: Teaching Practice and Learning Environment
• Component 4: Effective and Reflective Practitioner
Scoring of components occurs each summer and component scores are released online
by the end of that year.
7

Score Requirements
Achieving Certification
000002522
There are three scores a candidate must earn to achieve Certification:

✓ An assessment center (Component 1) section average at or above 1.75
✓ A portfolio (Components 2, 3 and 4) section average at or above 1.75
✓ A total weighted scaled score at or above 110

8

Component Scoring

Assessment Scores
What parts of the assessment are scored?
000007424
•

Components are scored during the assessment cycle, they were completed.
Ultimately, there are 7 components/parts for which candidates will receive scores.

•

These scores are used to calculate the 3 scores that will determine a candidate’s
certification status.

Assessment Center
Scores (4 scores)

Portfolio Scores
(3 scores)

• Component 1: Selected Response Items
• Component 1: Constructed Response Item #1
• Component 1: Constructed Response Item #2
• Component 1: Constructed Response Item #3

• Component 2: Differentiation in Instruction
• Component 3: Teaching Practice and Learning Environment
• Component 4: Effective and Reflective Practitioner

10

Component Scoring
How are components scored?
000007506
The method of scoring varies depending on the component/part.
Component 1: Selected Response Items
•

The multiple-choice section of Component 1 is machine-scored.

•

One point is awarded for a correct answer and zero points for an incorrect answer.

•

The number of items answered correctly is then converted to a rubric score between
0 and 4.25 (2.75 represents the lower bound of accomplished teaching).

11

Component Scoring
How are components scored?
000007506, 000002491
Component 1: Constructed Response Items and Components 2, 3, and 4
• Component 1’s open-ended questions and the portfolio components are scored by
highly trained teachers in the same certificate field, many of whom are NBCTs.
•

Responses are assessed solely on the criteria established by the National Board
Standards and embodied in the rubrics.

•

Rubric scores range between 0 and 4.25 (2.75 represents the lower bound of
accomplished teaching).

•

Scores reflect the degree to which assessors were able to locate clear, convincing and
consistent evidence that the candidate met the National Board Standards.

Understanding the
Scoring System

A Weighted Scoring Model
Percentage Weights and Scaling Weights
000007424
To understand how final scores are determined, it’s important to first grasp how each
component of the assessment is weighted:
•

Component Weights: Each part of the assessment has a specific percentage
weight, with some parts being more significant than others.

•

Scaling Factor: Each percentage weight is multiplied by a scaling factor for the
“minimally qualified candidate” to get a scaling weight for each component.
Percentage Weights
Component 1 CRIs
6.67% 6.67%
6.67%

Calculating Scores
Percentage Weights and Scaling Weights
000007424
Now that you understand the basic components and their weights, let’s look at how
these are used to calculate the final scores.
•

Unweighted Score: This is the raw rubric score (0 to 4.25) reflecting performance
on a component, rounded to three decimal places.

•

Weighted Scaled Score: The highest unweighted score is multiplied by the
component’s scaling weight to get the weighted scaled score, also rounded to three
decimal places.

•

Final Score Calculation: The highest unweighted scores (from initial attempts or
retakes) are used to calculate the total weighted scaled score.

•

The Score Report: When scores are released, candidates will see their unweighted
and weighted scaled scores on their score report, which provides a detailed
breakdown of their performance on each component.

15

Calculating the Score
Requirements

Score Requirements
Achieving Certification
000002522
After the components have been scored and weighted, each section’s scores are then
used to determine whether candidates meet the overall certification requirements. This
section will explain how these scores are combined and evaluated to ensure candidates
achieve the necessary benchmarks for certification:

1. An assessment center (Component 1) section average at or above 1.75
2. A portfolio (Components 2, 3 and 4) section average at or above 1.75
3. A total weighted scaled score at or above 110

17

Assessment Center Section Average
How is the Assessment Center Section Average Score calculated?
Certification Requirement #1: Get an average score of 1.75 or higher on Component 1.
Calculating the Average: The Assessment Center Section Average is calculated by
adding together the 4 unweighted scores for Component 1 and then dividing them
equally.
Example: This candidate earned scores of 2.750, 2.500, 2.750 and 2.863 for the
Assessment Center section. His Assessment Center Section Average Score is 2.716.

(2.750 + 2.500 + 2.750 + 2.863) / 4 = 2.716
18

Portfolio Section Average
How is the Portfolio Section Average Score calculated?
Certification Requirement #2: Get an average score of 1.75 or higher on Components 2
through 4.
Calculating the Average: The Portfolio Section Average is calculated by adding together
the 3 unweighted scores for Components 2, 3, and 4 and then dividing them equally.
Example: This candidate earned scores of 3.125, 2.750 and 2.250 for the Portfolio
section. Her Portfolio Section Average Score is 2.708.

19

The Total Weighted Scaled Score
How is the total weighted scaled score calculated?
Certification Requirement #3: Get a total weighted scaled score of at least 110.
Calculating the Total Score: A candidate’s highest unweighted scores are multiplied by
the scaling weights for each component and then added together to get the total weighted
scaled score, which is rounded to the nearest integer.
Example:

20

Achieving Board Certification
How do candidates achieve certification?
000002522
•

Only candidates who meet all three score requirements can achieve certification.

•

Meeting the Section Average requirements does not guarantee a candidate will meet
the minimum Total Weighted Scaled Score.

•

For many, the certification process is a multi-year process involving retakes.

Assessment Center Section
Average ≥ 1.75

Portfolio Section
Average ≥ 1.75

Total Weighted Scaled Score
≥ 110

21

The Score Report

Understanding the Score Report
The National Board will release scores no later than December 31 each year.
000007505
When scores are released,
candidates get an official score
report with detailed information
about their performance,
including:
1. Their certification status
2. Whether they’ve met each
certification requirement
3. Next steps
4. Individual component
scores and feedback (next
slide)

23

Understanding the Score Report
The National Board will release scores no later than December 31 each year.

If the candidate has completed
a retake, only the candidate’s
highest score for each
component will be included on
their score report.
If they earned a lower score on
a retake, they wt see it on their
score report. Instead, they’ll find
it on their score transcript.
Note: Only a portion of the
score report is shown here;
review the Scoring Guide for a
complete Score Report sample.

24

Certification Status
What does a candidate’s certification status mean?
000007505
There are four possible statuses that a candidate will see on their score report.
Certification Status

Definition

Candidates should…

Achieved Certification

Candidate attempted all four components and
met all three score requirements.

Stay engaged with the National Board. Update your
contact information as needed on your account.
Consider serving as a mentor to candidates or as an
assessor.

Certification in Progress

Candidate has not attempted one or more
components and are within their first three
years of candidacy. Certification status cannot
be determined until all four components have
been attempted.

Thoroughly review your score report and the Scoring
Guide. Be sure to attempt all four components within
the first three years of your candidacy. Once you
complete all four components, your certification status
can be determined.

Not Yet Achieved

Candidate attempted all four components but
has not met all three score requirements retake attempts available.

Thoroughly review your score report and the Scoring
Guide, pay particular attention to the Important
Completion and Retake Rules section. Use the
Scoring Guide to evaluate your performance and
prepare to retake components before the end of your
five-year window.

Note, candidates have up two retake attempts
for each component/part.
Did Not Achieve Certification

Candidate has attempted all four components,
but has not met all three score requirements,
and does not have retake attempts available
and/or they completed their fifth and last year
of candidacy.

Thoroughly review your score report and the Scoring
Guide. Consider continuing your pursuit of Boardcertification by starting the process anew.

25

N/A Designations
Why is there an N/A on the report?
000007505

Candidates will only have a complete score report with scores for every part, after they
have attempted all four components.
•

Assessment Center Section Average: If they haven’t attempted Component 1 or
the highest score for Component 1 is an NS (Not Scoreable), the average score for
that section will display “N/A.”

•

Portfolio Section Average: If they haven’t attempted all three portfolio components
or if highest score is NS (Not Scoreable) for any of the three portfolio components,
the average score for that section will display “N/A.”

•

Total Weighted Scaled Score: If they haven’t attempted all four components or
received an NS (Not Scoreable) for any component, the total weighted scaled score
will display “N/A.”

Note: This is different than an NS (Not Scoreable) designation.

26

Feedback Statements
What are feedback statements?
000002491
Feedback statements on a candidate’s score report provide insight about the quality of
their portfolio components:
•

Assessors assign feedback statements to guide candidates in the general areas in
which they might want to reevaluate their performance.

•

Feedback statements are provided only for portfolio component scores less than 3.75.

•

The Scoring Guide’s Evaluating Your Performance section includes guiding
questions candidates can use to help them understand why they received the scores
that they did, information for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of one’s
performance, and a description on how to use their feedback statements.

To learn more about feedback statements, review the Scoring Guide located online at
https://www.nbpts.org/certification/candidate-center/score-release/.
Note: Feedback is only given for portfolio components and is not provided for Component 1.

27

0 Scores
Why does the candidate have a score of “0” on their score report?
000007506
If a candidate gets a “0” (zero) on their score report, then one or more of the following
applies:
For a constructed response item, the submitted response did not meet the
requirements to receive the minimum score of 0.75 on a constructed response item.
For the portfolio components,
• a major piece of evidence such as the Written Commentary, the student work samples,
or the video recording was missing.
• the candidate wasn’t visible in the submitted video recording.
• the video recording was not viewable.
• the submission contained student work and/or video-recorded footage that was in a
language other than English and did not include an explanation or a translation.
• the video was edited outside of the editing rules.
• the video did not correspond to the Written Commentary.

28

NS Scores
Why does the candidate have a score of “NS” on their score report?
000007506
If a candidate gets an “NS” (Not Scorable) on their score report, then one or more of the
following applies:
For a constructed response item,
• the candidate didn’t schedule or attend an assessment center testing appointment.
• the candidate didn’t open the SRI part of the exam.
• the candidate didn’t open a constructed response item.
• the candidate was suspected of plagiarism or cheating.

For the portfolio components,
• the candidate didn’t submit a portfolio component.
• the candidate registered for but didn’t submit a component.
• the component submission featured students outside the defined age parameters.
• the component submission featured content outside the scope of the selected
certificate.
• the candidate were suspected of plagiarism or cheating.
Note: If a candidate receives an NS for any component, their Total Weighted Scaled Score will display N/A.
29

Score Transcript
Where can retake candidates see their scores for all cycles combined?
000007505
Unlike the score report which only shows the highest score earned for each component,
Score Transcripts show all scores for every completed component, including retakes.

30

Score Release and
Retakes

Releasing Scores
When and how are scores released?
000002522
•

Candidates in the 2023-24 assessment cycle will get scores on December 7, 2024.
This includes:
‒ Candidates pursuing their initial certification; and
‒ MOC candidates

•

Candidates access their scores by logging in to their National Board account.

•

The Scoring Guide: Understanding Your Scores provides important information
about assessors, score requirements, interpreting scores, the score report,
evaluating performance, retakes, and more. Candidates are encouraged to become
familiar with this resource in preparation of receiving scores.

32

Candidate Scores
What happens to scores after score release?
000007504
The National Board will automatically bank candidate scores during the certification
process as candidates work towards meeting the three score requirements.

The following rules apply:
• All four components must be attempted within the first three years of candidacy.
•

Every candidate has a five-year window to achieve certification.

•

There is no minimum or maximum score requirement to retake a component.

•

There are two retake attempts for each portfolio component. (Retake years do not
have to be consecutive.)

•

For Component 1, there are two retakes for each part, (SRIs and CRIs; retake years
do not have to be consecutive.)

•

The highest numeric score – whether it is the initial attempt or a retake score– will be
used to compute the total weighted score. Note: The highest score won’t be used if a
component is Not-Scorable (NS) due to disqualification and/or retake overlap.

33

Deciding to Retake
How does a candidate know when/what to retake?
000007504
A candidate won’t have all the information they need to definitively know whether to
retake a component until they have completed all four components.

Consider the following:
• Candidates who have not met the assessment center section average score
requirement will need to retake one or more parts of Component 1;
•

Candidates who have not met the portfolio section average score requirement will
need to retake one or more of the portfolio components;

•

Candidates won’t know if they’ll need to retake components to meet the total
weighted scaled score requirement until they have received scores for all four
components; and

•

Most importantly, there are NO SCORE REQUIRMENTS FOR RETAKES.
Candidates can retake any component they choose. They should aim to earn a 2.75
on each component. A score of 2.75 is the lowest rubric score in the range of clear
evidence of accomplished teaching practice. Candidates trying to decide what to
retake should start by looking at components with scores less than 2.75.
34

Score Calculator
How will retaking a component impact candidate scores?
Candidates can use the National Board’s online Score Calculator to measure the impact
of possible new scores and help develop their retake strategy.

35

Registering for Retakes
How do you register for retakes?
000007504, 000002568
•

Registering for retakes is the same as buying components for the first time.

‒ Candidates simply purchase the desired component from their certification
dashboard in their National Board account by the registration deadline.
‒ Candidates can use their score transcript and personalized Certification Progress
page (under My Journey) to confirm the components they’ve completed.
•

For Component 1, candidates can retake all or parts of Component 1. When
registering for Component 1 retakes:
‒ Candidates must purchase all the parts they plan to complete that cycle at the
same time.
‒ If they bought a part of Component 1 and need to buy more parts later, they’ll
need to withdraw their purchase and start again before the registration deadline.

36

Completing Retakes
How do you register for retakes?
000007173
Completing retakes is the same as completing components for the first time. These are
the rules for retaking portfolio components:

•

Analysis and reflection aspects of your teaching practice in the Written Commentary
must be completely new and original, not identical or amended versions from any
component previously submitted.

•

Student work samples and video recordings contained in a retake component must
be completely new and original and have occurred within the 12 months preceding
the opening of the ePortfolio Submission Window, not identical or amended versions
from any component previously submitted.

•

Descriptive aspects of your lesson or assignment in the Written Commentary and
some forms associated with the component may remain the same because you may
use the same lesson or assignment you previously submitted.

•

Candidates who don’t adhere to these rules will receive a not scorable (NS) for the
component on their score report. Rules Governing your Retake Submission are
published online in the General Portfolio Instructions.
37

New NBCTs

NBCT Certificates
When will NBCT certificates ship and how long are they valid?
000006621
Score Release Day will be a significant day for all candidates. While some may need
to retake components, many candidates will receive the exciting news of their certification.
•

Certification Validity: Candidates who meet the three score requirements for
certification will become National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) and will be issued
certificates that are valid for 5 years.

•

Downloading Certificates: NBCTs can easily download a copy of their certificate by
logging into their account and navigating to My Journey > Certification Progress.

•

Paper Copies: Paper copies will be shipped in early February. NBCTs should
confirm/update their mailing address within two weeks of receiving their scores to
avoid issues.

•

Preferred Name: We’ll print certificates using the preferred name provided in the
candidate’s account. Candidates who want to change the name on their certificate
should update the “Preferred Name for Certificate” field in their candidate profile within
two weeks of receiving their scores. Late requests are subject to a $25 charge.
39

#TeamNBCT Week
When will the NBCT Directory be updated?
000006621
•

•

•

NBCT Directory Update: The NBCT Directory will be updated with new NBCTs the
week following Score Release Day.
Reports and Statistics: New reports and National Board state statistics will be
released to the public in January during #TeamNBCT week, a public celebration of all
National Board Certified Teachers.
Always Celebrate Success: Congratulating candidates who certify will always
improve their experience. When interacting with NBCTs after Score Release, warmly
acknowledge their achievement and offer congratulations. This positive reinforcement
can significantly enhance the candidate’s overall experience and satisfaction.

40

Handling Complaints

Customer Support
Our goal is to providing clear and empathetic guidance.

Supporting candidates through Score Release can be challenging. While many will
celebrate their certification, others will have concerns about their scores. Addressing these
concerns with clarity and empathy is essential to ensure a fair and transparent process for
everyone.
Key Points:

•

Be Confident: Emphasize our commitment to fair and transparent processes. Trust
that scores are accurate and reflective of candidate performance.

•

Build Trust: Maintain clear and open communication to build trust and uphold the
integrity of the certification process.

•

Show Compassion: Offer compassionate responses to enhance the candidate
experience. It’s okay for candidates to be upset; help them feel valued and supported.

42

Empathy and Sensitivity
Understanding the Candidate Journey

Good customer support is crucial during Score Release. Imagine you are one of the
many candidates pursuing certification, some having spent years completing components.
The journey towards Board-certification can be an emotional roller coaster, and the
anxiety of receiving scores is the hardest part for some candidates.
Showing sensitivity to a candidate’s feelings (whether they are excited or sad) is important
and will often matter most for positive interactions.

Things You Can Say to Demonstrate Empathy
•

“I can’t imagine how upsetting it is to…”

•

“I realize how complicated it is to…”

•

“I can understand how frustrating it is when…”

43

Understanding Candidate Concerns
Common Complaints and Questions
Remember! We are confident and trust candidate scores are valid and reliable.
However, many candidates will contact Customer Support with concerns about low scores
and the feedback assigned during scoring. Common questions include:
•

“What did I do wrong?”

•

“Can I get more personalized feedback?”

•

“How do I request rescoring?”

Our Support Strategy
1. Rely on your Resources: Take advantage of the knowledge. Score Release articles
have been updated this year to include new comprehensive FAQs that fully address
score-related questions and concerns both clearly and compassionately.
2. Stick to the Facts: Share the information that is documented and outline procedures
when requested, but don’t offer personal advice or speculation.
3. Maintain a Positive Tone: Always communicate in a positive and supportive manner.
Acknowledge the candidate’s efforts and encourage them, regardless of their score
outcome.

44

From Empathy to Action
What are the options for candidates that disagree with their scores?
000002484; 000004390; 000002491
Relay Confidence in the Scoring Process: While we trust the validity and reliability of
our scores, candidates with concerns have two options as outlined in the knowledge base:

1. Score Verification: Offers candidates the option to have one or more scores
reviewed to ensure they were accurately calculated and reported.
✓ Fee: $75 for each score verified
✓ Deadline: 30 days after Score Release
✓ Processing Time: 30 days
2. Appeals: Allows candidates to challenge the scoring process if they believe there was
a procedural error or bias
✓ Fee: $500
✓ Deadline: 60 days after Score Release
✓ Processing Time: 3 months
Note: Neither option provides additional feedback or rescoring. The National Board does
not offer a service for rescoring or more feedback.

The National Board
and Certification

By Teachers for Teachers
Recognized as the “gold standard” in teacher certification, the National Board believes
higher standards for teachers means better learning for students.
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was founded in 1987 to
advance the quality of teaching and learning by:
•

Maintaining high and rigorous Standards for what accomplished teachers should
know and be able to do;

•

Providing a national voluntary certification process for teachers who meet these
standards; and

•

Advocating related education reforms to integrate National Board Certification in
American education and to capitalize on the expertise of National Board Certified
Teachers.

National Board Certification was designed to develop, retain and recognize
accomplished teachers and to generate ongoing improvement in schools nationwide. It is
the most respected professional certification available in K-12 education.

5

National Board Certification
Elevating Teaching, Empowering Teachers
•

National Board Certification is a voluntary assessment program designed to
develop, retain and recognize accomplished teachers, and to embed ongoing
improvement in schools nationwide.

•

National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) are highly accomplished educators who
meet the rigorous standards set by the National Board.

•

National Board Certification is an advanced credential. While state teacher
credentialing programs set the basic requirements to teach in each state, NBCTs must
demonstrate advanced teaching knowledge, skills and practices. It complements, but
does not replace, a state's teaching certificate or school counseling license.

6

Maintenance of Certification
Accomplished teachers recognize that professional learning and growth never ends.
•

Maintenance of Certification (MOC) was designed by teachers based on best
assessment practices to ensure Board-certified teachers continue to grow
professionally while maintaining a strong impact on student learning.

•

MOC is the pathway for NBCTs to keep their certification active.

•

Successfully completing MOC extends an NBCT’s certificate by five years from their
certificate’s expiration date.

7

MOC Scoring and
Results

The Evaluation Process
How are portfolio submissions evaluated?
000012571, 000002515
•

After submissions are completed in the Spring, materials are sent for scoring.

•

Highly trained NBCTs independently and holistically evaluate the interrelated
components as a single body of work to reach a decision — to maintain or not
maintain certification.

•

Assessors are trained extensively to evaluate this body of information and to minimize
the effects of personal biases on the decision they make when viewing the evidence.

•

Submissions are assessed solely on the criteria established by the Standards and
embodied in the rubrics.

9

Decision Reports
Unlike the initial certification process, MOC candidates don’t receive numerical scores
– their score report is comprised of a single certification decision.
In this example we see the certification decision for an NBCT who successfully
completed Maintenance of Certification.

10

Not Maintaining Certification
What are recommendations for focus?
000002515, 000011941
•

If certification is not maintained, an NBCT's decision report will include
recommendations for focus.

•

Recommendations for focus are based on the evaluation rubric and specify key
aspects of a candidate’s submission that could be improved with stronger evidence.

•

To understand a “Not Maintained” decision and how their submission could have been
strengthened, NBCTs should review the recommendations provided on their score
report while examining their work, the Five Core Propositions, the Standards, and
the Evaluation Rubric in their instructions.

To learn more about the evaluation process, review the resources provided on the Score
Release page of the National Board website.

11

Not Maintaining Certification
In addition to recommendations for focus, decision reports for NBCTs that don’t
maintain certification will include their eligibility status and whether they can try again.
In this example the NBCT did not successfully complete Maintenance of
Certification and their eligibility status is highlighted in yellow – they can try again.

12

Score Release and
What to Expect

Releasing Decisions
When and how will decisions be released?
000011941
•

Candidates in the 2023-24 assessment cycle will get scores on December 7, 2024.
This includes:
‒ Candidates pursuing their initial certification; and
‒ MOC candidates

•

Candidates access their scores by logging in to their National Board account.

•

99% of candidates who attempt MOC are successful. The most common questions
from NBCTs on Score Release Day pertain to confirming their NBCT status and
obtaining a new certificate.

14

NBCT Certificates
When will NBCT certificates ship?
000006621
Score Release Day will be a significant day for all candidates, especially those who
maintained their certification.
•

Certification Validity: NBCTs who successfully complete Maintenance of Certification
will extend their certificate expiration date by 5 years.

•

Downloading Certificates: NBCTs can easily download a copy of their certificate by
logging into their account and navigating to My Journey > Certification Progress.

•

Paper Copies: Updated paper copies will be shipped in early February. NBCTs should
confirm/update their mailing address within two weeks of receiving their scores to
avoid issues.

•

Preferred Name: Like initial certification candidates, we’ll print certificates using the
preferred name provided in the candidate’s account. Candidates who want to change
the name on their certificate should update the “Preferred Name for Certificate” field in
their candidate profile within two weeks of receiving their scores. Late requests are
subject to a $25 charge.

Handling Complaints

Customer Support
Our goal is to providing clear and empathetic guidance.

Supporting MOC candidates through Score Release is easier than those pursuing initial
certification, but it can still be challenging. While many will be celebrating, some will learn
they didn’t maintain certification.
Remember: Addressing these concerns with clarity and empathy is essential to ensure a
fair and transparent process for everyone.

Key Points:
•

Be Confident: Emphasize our commitment to fair and transparent processes. Trust
that scores are accurate and reflective of candidate performance.

•

Build Trust: Maintain clear and open communication to build trust and uphold the
integrity of the certification process.

•

Show Compassion and Empathy: Offer compassionate and empathetic responses to
enhance the candidate experience. It’s okay for candidates to be upset; help them feel
valued and supported.

18

Understanding Candidate Concerns

19

Certification Not Maintained
What next?
000002515; 000011408
When addressing concerns about not maintaining certification, keep in mind that each
NBCT is given two opportunities to maintain their certification prior to their certificate
expiration date.
•

Eligibility Check: Verify if the candidate is eligible to try again in their account under
My Journey > Certification Progress.

•

Reapplication for MOC: NBCTs that are eligible for MOC in the 2024-25 assessment
cycle can try again. The MOC registration deadline is February 28, 2025.
‒ Note: NBCTs who reapply will need to resubmit a portfolio during the next
ePortfolio Submission Window. They must ensure their material adheres to the
MOC instructions; however, they can use as much of their original submission as
they see fit. (Note: This allowance DOES NOT apply to initial certification
candidates.)

•

Final Year of Eligibility: NBCTs whose final year of eligibility was the 2023-24
assessment cycle will not be able to continue with MOC. Their certification will expire
on December 31, 2024. They can apply again as a first-time candidate, if they choose.
20

From Empathy to Action
What are the options for candidates that disagree with their scores?
000004390
Relay Confidence in the Scoring Process: While we trust the validity and reliability of
our scores, MOC candidates with concerns do have the option to file an appeal.

•

Appeals: Allows candidates to challenge the scoring process if they believe there was
a procedural error or bias
✓ Fee: $500
✓ Deadline: 60 days after Score Release
✓ Processing Time: 3 months

Note: Filing an appeal will not provide additional score feedback or rescoring. The

2. Create a username and password
3. Enter their name and contact information
4. Click the final Create Account button

•

Creating an account generates a user’s Certification Dashboard and Candidate ID.

9

My Profile
•

Clicking My Profile from the left-hand navigation displays the user’s contact
information and address.

•

Clicking Update profile allows users to edit many of their profile fields.

10

Choosing a Certificate Area
•

National Board Certification is available in 25 certificate areas representing 16
different disciplines and four developmental levels. Before a candidate can purchase
components they must choose a certificate area.

•

Candidates click Choose Certificate from the left-hand navigation to pick the
certificate area they want to complete and save it to their dashboard.

11

Registering for Certification
•

During the registration window, candidate’s can click Register Now on their
Certification Dashboard to –
1. Complete the Candidate Registration Agreement; and
2. Pay the annual $75 registration fee.

•

Only candidates who complete registration can purchase components. The Guide to
National Board Certification includes step-by-step instructions.

12

Purchasing Initial and Retake Components
•

After paying the registration fee and saving a certificate area to their dashboard,
initial certification candidate’s can purchase their components. (Note: This process is
different for Maintenance of Certification (MOC) – see the next slide for details.)

•

Candidates click the component links from their dashboard to start their purchase
and finalize payment; components are purchased separately.

13

Purchasing MOC
•

After paying the registration fee, during the registration window, eligible NBCTs will
have the option to purchase Maintenance of Certification (MOC) on their dashboard.

•

If the window isn’t open or if it's too soon to start MOC, the option to purchase MOC
will not be available.

14

Requesting Accommodations
•

If a candidate needs Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) testing accommodations
to complete their component or MOC, they can request accommodations and upload
their supporting documents, prior to finalizing payment during the component and
MOC purchase process.

15

Finalizing Payment
•

Candidates need to finalize their payment prior to the registration deadline to
complete their purchase. Payment options include:​
o Electronic payment – Visa or MasterCard only​
o Payment plan – Candidates split the cost of components in 6 equal automatic
monthly payments, with no extra fees or costs to the candidate
o Third-party payment – Candidates use funding from a district, school, or other
organization

•

Candidates without third-party funding can choose between paying in full or setting
up a payment plan to complete their purchase.

16

Using Third-Party Funding
•

Candidates expecting third-party funding can check if it’s been posted to their
account anytime by clicking Payment Portal from the left-hand navigation.

•

If a candidate has third-party funding, it will automatically be available for them to
complete their component purchase during checkout.

17

Expecting Third-Party Funding
•

If a candidate anticipates TPP funding but it hasn’t been posted to their account yet,
they can initiate the purchase, check the "I am expecting third-party funding..." flag,
and once the TPP funds are posted to their account, those funds will automatically be
applied towards their purchase.​

•

Only candidates who have answered “yes” to the TPP release question will be able
to check the "expecting funding" flag.​

•

If a candidate checks the flag and the TPP funding isn’t posted to their account by
the TPP funding designation deadline they will need to submit a personal payment to
finalize their purchase before the candidate registration deadline.

18

The Certification Dashboard
•

After completing payment, purchased components are added to a candidate’s
Certification Dashboard.

•

During the designated windows, the Certification Dashboard provides candidates
self-service options for:
➢ Withdrawals;
➢ ePortfolio submission; and
➢ Assessment center scheduling

19

My Journey
•

Whether they are just starting the certification process or planning for Maintenance of
Certification (MOC), candidates can track their progress by clicking My Journey from
the left-hand navigation.

•

My Journey includes five sections that provide information on candidate deadlines, a
candidate’s registration and purchase history, their certification progress and more.

20

My Journey – Certification Progress
•

The Certification Progress section is perhaps the most useful section in My Journey.
It provides candidates working towards Board-certification a visual of their 5-year
window to achieve certification and the components they’ve purchased.

•

When certification is achieved, the Certification Progress section provides
certification details including the certification expiration date and the assessment
cycles when Maintenance of Certification (MOC) can be purchased.

Timeline of Events
•

Scores for candidates who completed components during the 2022-23 assessment cycle will be
released on Saturday, December 9, 2023. This includes candidates pursuing certification and
Maintenance of Certification (MOC).

•

Candidates have been told to expect scores by noon. Internally, we anticipate releasing scores just after
12:00 AM CT.

•

Our #TeamNBCT celebration will take place in early January.

•

Several notifications reminding candidates about Score Release and how to prepare have already been
sent and the date is published on the National Board's website. Next week we'll send a reminder to
those whose scores are being held and won't be released. Then the day of Score Release, we'll email
everybody whose scores and certification decisions are posted.

3

Score Release Cheat Sheet and Available Knowledge
•

We will release your score results to you via your personal National Board account. If your score report
indicates you have achieved certification or have successfully maintained certification, your new or
updated credential will be added to your National Board account under “My Certifications” within 48
hours of score release.

•

The knowledge base has in-depth information about National Board policies and procedures. The Score
Release Cheat Sheet is a great a snapshot to guide you through Score Release topics.

4

Holding Scores
•

There are several reasons a candidate might not get their score report on time.
• They didn't complete their payment plan(s)
• They didn't complete payment for a service fee
• They didn't complete the eligibility audit
• We requested information pertaining to their candidacy and they never responded

•

If you don't see their score report, check the following articles for an unpaid service fee or a past due
payment plan balance - 000002519 and 000012129.
• If they don't have an unpaid service fee or a past due payment plan balance, check One CRM for a
"Scores on Hold" case for next-steps and instructions.
• If the candidate doesn't have a "Scores on Hold" case, escalate the case to the Program Team.

5

Rescoring, Score Verification and Appeals
•

Candidate scores are valid and reliable; the National Board will not rescore an entry or provide
personalized feedback. Encourage candidates to review the previously recorded Understanding your
Score and Feedback statements webinar and the Scoring Guide’s Evaluating Your Performance section along
with the scoring rubrics to fully understand their scores and how to use their feedback statements.

•

The Score Verification Service offers first-time candidates the option to have one or more scores verified
by selecting from specific verification options. (These are the same verification steps completed prior to
score release.)
• The fee is $75 per service for each score verified.
• The deadline to submit a request is 30 days from the date scores were reported (January 8, 2024).
• The National Board requires 30 days to investigate and resolve requests.

•

Candidates can also file an appeal if they think they have good cause, but most candidates who file an
appeal don’t.
• The fee for filing an appeal is $500.
• The filing deadline is 60 days from the date scores were reported. (February 7, 2024).
• The National Board requires 3 months to investigate and resolve an appeal.

The National Board

By Teachers for Teachers
Recognized as the “gold standard” in teacher certification, the National Board believes
higher standards for teachers means better learning for students.
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was founded in 1987 to
advance the quality of teaching and learning by:
•

Maintaining high and rigorous Standards for what accomplished teachers should
know and be able to do;

•

Providing a national voluntary certification process for teachers who meet these
standards; and

•

Advocating related education reforms to integrate National Board Certification in
American education and to capitalize on the expertise of National Board Certified
Teachers.

National Board Certification was designed to develop, retain and recognize
accomplished teachers and to generate ongoing improvement in schools nationwide. It is
the most respected professional certification available in K-12 education.

5

The Foundation
What Teachers Should Know and Be Able to Do
Developed and revised by practicing educators based on research and practitioner
expertise, the National Board Five Core Propositions and Standards describe what
accomplished teachers should know and be able to do to have a positive impact on
student learning.
National Board Certification identifies teachers who meet those standards through a
(voluntary) performance-based, peer-reviewed series of assessment components.

6

The Foundation
What Teachers Should Know and Be Able to Do.
Like medicine’s Hippocratic Oath, the Five Core Propositions are held in common by
teachers of all grade levels and disciplines and underscore the accomplished teacher’s
commitment to advancing student learning and achievement.
Together, the propositions form the basis of all National Board Standards, which
describe how teachers enact the Propositions in particular content areas and with
students of particular developmental levels and serve as the foundation for Board
certification.

National Board
Certification

National Board Certification
Elevating Teaching, Empowering Teachers
•

National Board Certification is a voluntary assessment program designed to
develop, retain and recognize accomplished teachers, and to embed ongoing
improvement in schools nationwide.

•

National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) are highly accomplished educators who
meet the rigorous standards set by the National Board.

•

National Board Certification is an advanced credential. While state teacher
credentialing programs set the basic requirements to teach in each state, NBCTs must
demonstrate advanced teaching knowledge, skills and practices. It complements, but
does not replace, a state's teaching certificate or school counseling license.

10

Reasons to Certify
Elevating Teaching, Empowering Teachers
There are many reasons to become board-certified. Board-certified teachers prove their
effectiveness in the classroom every day.

Students Learn More.
A decade of research shows that students of
Board-certified teachers learn more than their
peers without Board-certified teachers. Studies
have also found that the positive impact of
having a Board-certified teacher is even greater
for minority and low-income students.
Teachers Improve their Practice.
Board Certification allows teachers to hone their
practice, showcase their talent in the classroom
and demonstrate their dedication to their
students and their profession.

11

Benefits to Board Certification
Elevating Teaching, Empowering Teachers
Board Certification Opens Doors
• Board-certified teachers are often given opportunities to have an impact way beyond
their individual classrooms.
• Because Board-certified teachers are recognized as experts, they are often sought out
for leadership positions in their schools and districts.
• In significant numbers, NBCTs serve as team leaders, department chairs, and
instructional coaches. Many NBCTs move on to serve as school and district
administrators or within the state department of education.

Financial Benefits
• More than half of all states—and countless districts—offer free support, conditional
loans and/or salary incentives to encourage teachers to pursue and achieve National
Board Certification.
• Many states count Board certification towards state licensure, renewal or step
increase.

12

The Certificate Areas
Created by Teachers, for Teachers
National Board Certification is available in 25 certificate areas representing 16
different disciplines and four developmental levels; it is applicable to most teachers in U.S.
public schools.

13

Eligibility Requirements
For First-time (and Returning) Candidates
To be eligible for board certification, teachers must meet education, employment, and
licensure requirements described in the Guide to National Board Certification.
.

Possess a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution. NOTE: Candidates
for the Career and Technical Education certificate are required to hold a
bachelor’s degree only if their state required one for their current license.
Complete three years of successful teaching in one or more early childhood,
elementary, middle, or secondary school. This requirement must be met before a
candidate will be eligible to achieve certification – they may begin the certification
process before completing three years of successful teaching.
Hold a valid state teaching license (or meet the licensure requirements
established by your state for a school counselor if applying for the ECYA/School
Counseling certificate) for each of the three years of employment verified.
Provide official American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL)
certified ratings of Advanced Low or higher from ACTFL speaking and writing
proficiency assessments if registering as a World Languages candidate.
Note: Candidates may be randomly selected to participate in an eligibility audit. Audited
candidates are required to submit documentation verifying their eligibility status.
14

The Process

The Certification Process
Performance Based and Peer Reviewed
Similar to certification in fields like medicine, National Board Certification is a rigorous,
peer-reviewed process that ensures that Board-certified teachers have proven skills to
advance student achievement.
To become Board-certified, eligible candidates must demonstrate advanced knowledge,
skills, and practice in their individual certificate area (based on the Standards) by
successfully completing four evidence-based components.
Computer-based assessment
• Component 1: Content Knowledge (comprised of 4 parts - 1 selected response part
and 3 constructed response items)

Portfolio entries
• Component 2: Differentiation in Instruction
• Component 3: Teaching Practice and Learning Environment
• Component 4: Effective and Reflective Practitioner

16

The Certification Timeline
For First-time (and Returning) Candidates
The National Board’s timeline provides ample flexibility for getting certified.
•

After registering, candidates have a 5-year window to achieve certification:
o 3 years to complete their first attempt of all four components, plus
o 2 extra years for retakes to raise candidate scores.
• Components are purchased individually and can be purchased in any order.
Note:
• Components must be completed
during the assessment cycle in
which they are purchased; the
National Board doesn’t offer
deferrals.
• Candidates don’t have to work on
component every year during their
5-year window but skipping a year
won’t extend their 5-year window.

Scoring & Achieving
Certification

The Scoring Process
For First-time (and Returning) Candidates
•

Components are scored during the summer and scores are released online by
December 31.

•

Assessors are classroom teachers in the same certificate field as those they assess.
Many assessors are National Board Certified Teachers. All assessors are extensively
trained and must qualify before they can review and assess submissions.

•

Ultimately, a candidate's scores reflect the degree to which assessors were able to
locate clear, convincing and consistent evidence that they met the Standards.

•

The Scoring Guide in the Candidate Center explains everything.

33

Achieving Board Certification
How do candidates achieve certification?
•

There are three score requirements for achieving National Board Certification.
1. An assessment center (Component 1) section average at or above 1.75
2. A portfolio (Components 2, 3 and 4) section average at or above 1.75
3. A total weighted scaled score at or above 110

•

For many, meeting the score requirements is a multi-year process involving retakes.

•

Board-certified teachers receive certificates that are valid for 5 years. (After initial
certification, NBCTs keep it active through Maintenance of Certification (MOC).)​

Assessment Center
Section Average ≥ 1.75
Portfolio Section
Average ≥ 1.75
Total Weighted Scaled
Score ≥ 110

Call Handling and Escalations
•

Pearson is responsible for handling all candidate issues.

•

Agents should take advantage of all available resources, especially the knowledge
base, when working with National Board Customers.

•

Only escalate cases to 1.5 Support, unless directed specifically by a knowledge article.

✓ Inquiries requiring extensive research or an exception to policy, may require
escalation to the National Board Program Team. Escalate the case via One CRM to
NAUS-SA: NB Escalations - Tier 3. In most cases, the Program Team will respond
to the customer via email unless a call back is specifically requested.
Inquiry Response Time
•

Do NOT tell National Board customers that they will get a response in 24 hours.

•

In most instances, customers should receive a response within 5 business days;
however, depending on the complexity of some issues it may take longer.
